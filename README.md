# aws-rekognition-project
This project is a serverless image recognition system on AWS. I uploaded images to S3, used Lambda to detect labels via Rekognition, stored results in S3 and DynamoDB, and received SNS email alerts for special labels. I learned how AWS services work together in a real workflow.
Project Idea and Goal:
I wanted to make a small project where I could practice AWS services and see how they work together. My goal was to upload an image and automatically get:

Detected labels (like objects in the image)

Store results in S3 and DynamoDB

Receive an email alert if certain labels appear
I knew it would help me understand serverless workflows and event-driven programming.
How to integrate AWS services: S3 → Lambda → Rekognition → DynamoDB → SNS

How event-driven architecture works

How to store and retrieve data in DynamoDB

How to send automated alerts with SNS

How to structure a cloud project professionally for portfolio

How to troubleshoot errors using CloudWatch logs

Overall, it was a big learning experience, and I feel confident now about creating real intermediate-level AWS projects.
