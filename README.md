# aws-rekognition-project
This project is a serverless image recognition system on AWS. I uploaded images to S3, used Lambda to detect labels via Rekognition, stored results in S3 and DynamoDB, and received SNS email alerts for special labels. I learned how AWS services work together in a real workflow.
